### **What are the current Chiplet technologies?**

1. **AMD EPYC and Ryzen processors**: AMD is one of the pioneers in Chiplet technology. Its EPYC server processors and Ryzen series processors widely use Chiplet architecture. By integrating multiple chiplets (such as CPU cores and I/O units), AMD has improved performance while reducing costs. For example, the EPYC processor enhances the computing capabilities of data centers through multi-chiplet structures, allowing different modules to be manufactured using the most suitable process nodes, optimizing performance and power consumption.

2. **Intel Agilex FPGA**: Intel's Agilex FPGA series also uses Chiplet technology, primarily for data-intensive tasks and high-performance computing. It achieves high-speed communication between different chiplets through EMIB (Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge), making it suitable for AI acceleration and real-time computing.

3. **TeraPHY Optical I/O Chiplet Technology**: TeraPHY is a high-bandwidth, low-power optical I/O solution, particularly suitable for high-performance computing and big data centers. By using optical chiplets, TeraPHY breaks through the limitations of traditional electrical I/O, enabling high-speed communication between chips.

4. **UCIe (Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express) Standard**: UCIe is an open industry standard for interconnecting different vendors' chiplets at the package level. It supports high-bandwidth, low-latency communication, allowing various functional modules to be freely combined within the system. This standard promotes multi-vendor chip integration and is suitable for various heterogeneous computing environments.

5. **Chiplet-Gym Optimization Platform**: Chiplet-Gym is an optimization platform designed for AI accelerators, using reinforcement learning to optimize chip performance, power consumption, and cost. It provides a flexible design platform for AI acceleration, allowing workloads to be allocated more efficiently.
